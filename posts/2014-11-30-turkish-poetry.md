title: Testing the waters with poetry translation

tags: turkish, poetry, translation
description: I translated a couple of famous Turkish poems to English. It turns out that translation is fun and tough. I'll also ramble a bit about adaptation to the US.

I guess I'll start with an unnecessary rationale.

I haven't been able to write a piece of my own for some time. I used to be
better at writing, but I guess I'm just not that creative when it comes to writing.
After starting to live in an English speaking environment, I also noticed that
I was much less expressive in my daily life. I was just not witty anymore.
Culturally, I didn't have much in common with the people around me, so I could
hardly make any political or cultural joke references.

In the middle of my second year in the US, I can say I have made a lot of progress
about this problem. But when I couldn't say this, I needed a way to convey
who I am, and I have always loved Turkish music and poetry, so why not try one of those?
Singing is also fun, but after meeting amazingly talented people, I don't think
I should try that. Translation, on the other hand, is something I think I do okay.

Of course, poetry translation has a lot of issues. One has to work on how to
keep the poet's tone, rhythm and structure. One can try to recreate the rhythm in
the target language, but I usually feel like I have to give up too much meaning
when I do that. I prefer to preserve the word choices of the poet, even though they
can become very tricky sometimes. Also, sometimes the sentence just grammatically
doesn't make sense. Even in that case, I translated it into a grammatically
correct English sentence. This is a loss of meaning and I can certainly
work more on trying to keep the intended ambiguity in the target language.
I'm an amateur, after all. So, I know that translated poems lose some meaning,
there's not much I can do about that, other than trying to keep as much meaning as possible.
If the objective is to reflect the poet's tone, there's no way for me to succeed.

After some long blabbering, here are my translations:

I'll edit this list if I ever translate more poems.

Enjoy, and please let me know what you think about them. I'm open to any kind
of suggestions. (word choice, grammar, punctuation, etc.)
