I guess I never had a blog that regularly kept writing, and I doubt this will
ever be one, but I needed a place to keep my writings. Otherwise I was just
going to use GitHub repositories for any kind of text, which is not much fun.

Well, there is a fun part of it: [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
is awesome. Since I needed a blog
system that used Markdown, I looked into [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
and [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). Even though
Jekyll was simpler to configure, I was beaten by my Haskell pride,
which is why I spent a couple of hours trying to configure this blog
in a way that I want. I'm pleased with the result I got.

It's time to show off the features of my configuration. I'm currently
using [Disqus](http://disqus.com) for comments and
[Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) to see how many people
are visiting. If I write, this will be a programming blog, so it's nice to have
the syntax highlighting features like this:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = getLine >>= putStrLn
```

Thanks [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)!
I can also use [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/),
with the help of [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/):

\\[ \\mathbb{M}_P = T_P(\\emptyset) \\cup (T_P)^2(\\emptyset) \\cup (T_P)^3(\\emptyset) \\cup (T_P)^4(\\emptyset) \\]

Sweet. Now, let's hope I'll have the time and patience to write an actual blog post.

The blog source code is available [here](http://github.com/cattheory/blog).
